\title{Run a server}
\usage{
runServer(host, port, app, interruptIntervalMs = ifelse(interactive(), 100,
  1000))
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{A string that is a valid IPv4 address that is owned by this
server, or \code{"0.0.0.0"} to listen on all IP addresses.}

\item{port}{A number or integer that indicates the server port that should be
listened on. Note that on most Unix-like systems including Linux and Mac OS
X, port numbers smaller than 1025 require root privileges.}

\item{app}{A collection of functions that define your application. See
\code{\link{startServer}}.}

\item{interruptIntervalMs}{How often to check for interrupt. The default
  should be appropriate for most situations.}
}
\description{
This is a convenience function that provides a simple way to call
\code{\link{startServer}}, \code{\link{service}}, and
\code{\link{stopServer}} in the correct sequence. It does not return unless
interrupted or an error occurs.
}
\details{
If you have multiple hosts and/or ports to listen on, call the individual
functions instead of \code{runServer}.
